        <!-- Summary -->
        <h4 class="subTitle">Summary</h4>
        <p>I am a husband and a father of two awesome boys. I received my associates of Science degree from Dixie State
            University studying generals. Currently I work at a cabinet shop cutting molding. I have done this for almost four
            years. It is fun and a great skill to have. One class I took during my final semester at Dixie was Web Development
            class. I learned basic HTML and CSS during that and I found I really enjoyed it! After that class I practiced HTML and
            CSS to improve my skill and learn more. I finished a coding boot camp class through the University of Utah in April of 2020. That course was a great learning experience and I continue to try and expand on that knowledge.</p>
